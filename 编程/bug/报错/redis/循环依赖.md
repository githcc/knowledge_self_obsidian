APPLICATION FAILED TO START
***************************

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌──->──┐
|  api/expand/user
└──<-──┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.

```
Redisson的bean与使用放在了同一个文件，导致循环依赖
方式一：找出循环依赖的源头
方式二：添加属性自动中断循环依赖 spring.main.allow-circular-references=true
